    "- Why TS forecasting is important\n",
    "- What's different? -> Before: Local methods; Now: Global methods\n",
    "- Extensive empirical evaluation of those who developed the algorithm. DeepAR is the go-to time series forecasting algorithm in AWS. TM: Value judgement to the disadvantage of ARIMAETS?\n",
    "- Local methods: Based on ARIMA, ES, state space or some combinations (exclude ML combinations)?\n",
    "- Global method: New type of forecasting -> Availability of hundreds or thousands of series that are related or generated by a common process...; \n",
    "- DeepAR: Autoregressive recurrent networks which learns a global model from historical data of al time series in the data set.\n",
    " - LSTM-based recurrent neural network architecture\n",
    "- Providing better forecast accuracy than previous methods?\n",
    "- Additional key advantages: \n",
    " - i) minimial feature engineering; \n",
    " - ii) probabilistic forecasts (monte carlo) -> Can be used o compute consisten quantile estimates for all sub-ranges in the prediction horizon.\n",
    " - iii) cold-start forecasting - No history at all required if similar series is added. \n",
    " - iv) Can incorporate wide range of likelihood functions\n",

    "- Examples of forecasting individual time series include foremost ARIMA models and exponential smoothing methods.\n",
    "- Sharing information across individual time series: Can improve forecast accuracy but is difficult in practice\n",
    "- Using RNN and train these networks on all data simultaneously.\n",
    "- Main difference here: 1) Probabilistic forecasting (i.e. interested in entire distribution) 2) To obtain accurate distribution for (unbounded) count data --> Negative Binomial likelihood. \n",

    "### DeepAR highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Claims to be able to be more accurate compared to classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA or ES.\n",
    "- Cold start forecasting: Can generate forecast for a time series with little or no existing historical data (forecasts based on the net trained with similar series)\n",
    "- Can produce points forecasts as well as probabilistic forecasts (i.e. forecast lies between X and Y with Z% probability)\n",
    "- Information sharing across series\n",
    "- DeepAR forecasting algorithm can be used with AWS \n",

    "### DeepAR Forecasting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notes are based on Amazon's documentation: [DeepAR Forecasting Algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html) as one of the built-in algorithms in the Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "> DeepAR forecasting algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting **scalar (one-dimensional)** time series using **recurrent neural networks (RNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods, such as ARIMA or ETS, fit a single model to each individual time series. Subsequently, this model is used to extrapolate the time series into the future. There is no information sharing between the individual time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of similar or related time series (how similar do they have to be?) information sharing may be beneficial. Examples include time series grouping where individual series are related to each other like products, server loads, household electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this type of application, one may benefit from training a single model jointly over all of the time series using a recurrent neural network (RNN). One example of this approach is the DeepAR algorithm. In case the dataset contains hundreds of related time series, DeepAR outperforms the standard ARIMA and ETS methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training of the DeepAR algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input is one or, preferably, more target time series that hve been gnerated by the same process or similar processes\n",
    "- Based on this input, the algorithm trains a model that learns an approximation of this process/processes and uses it to predict how the target time series evolves. \n",
    "- Target time series can be optionally associated with a vector of static (time-independent) categorical features provided by the `cat` field \n",
    "- Target time series can also be associated with a vector of dynamic (time-dependent) time series provided by the `dynamic_feat` field. \n",
    "- SageMaker trains the DeepAR model by randomly sampling training examples from each target time series in the training dataset.\n",
    "- Each training example consists of a pair of adjacent context and prediction windows with fixed predefined lengths\n",
    " - Control how far in the past the network can see, use `context_length` hyperparameter.\n",

    "During tuning of a DeepAR model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split data in training and test dataset\n",
    " - To create training and test data that fit the criteria (algorithm does not see test data): Use entire dataset as a test and remov last `prediction_length` points of each time series for training\n",
    " \n",
    "- Avoid using very large values for the `prediction_length` becaust this makes the model slow and less accuracte\n",
    " - In those cases: Consider aggregating data at a higher frequence (5min instead of 1min).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lags enable model to look further back in the time series than the value specified for `context_length`. \n",
    " - Hence, `context_length` does not need to be large\n",
    " - Recommendation: Start with `context_length` equal to `prediction_length`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, it is recommended to train DeepAR on as many time series as are available.\n",
